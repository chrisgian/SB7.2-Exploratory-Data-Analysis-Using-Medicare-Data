Focusing on a single market would be the best solution in directing a story line. Given that an audience member has understood initial localized markets -- the next step would be to show a larger national picture where they can ask questions about broader implications of local markets. I believe this is important because local health care markets, being so different, provide an opportunity to understand the driving differences in the post-acute sector where region-specific variables such as cost of living, age distribution,  demographic distribution, family / mental health dynamics, and of course transportation plays a large role. \n",
